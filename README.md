# MedConnect-Server
This repository contains the API server for the Medical Appointment Scheduling App. The server is built using Node.js with TypeScript and Express, and it communicates with a MongoDB database to manage appointments and patient data.

**Features**

Appointment Management: The API server provides endpoints to manage appointments, including creating new appointments, retrieving appointment details, updating appointments, and canceling appointments.

Patient Data Management: The server handles patient data, allowing for the creation and retrieval of patient profiles, including personal information and uploaded medical analyses.

API Authentication: The server supports authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to the API endpoints. It verifies user credentials and provides access tokens for authorized users.

**Technologies Used**

The API server is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side development. It provides an event-driven architecture and a vast ecosystem of modules.

TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that brings type-checking capabilities to the application. It enhances code quality and improves developer productivity by catching errors at compile-time.

Express: Express is a popular web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of robust APIs. It provides a set of middleware and utility functions for handling HTTP requests and building RESTful APIs.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL document database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It provides scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for managing various types of data.
